# Data Entry Project: Professional Contacts Dataset

## Objective
This project demonstrates my ability to manually extract, clean, and organize data from an image into a structured spreadsheet. The dataset includes professional contact information, such as names, titles, companies, addresses, and email addresses.

---

## Source
The data was manually entered from an image containing contact details of professionals in various organizations. The image can be viewed [here](Associates catalogue.pdf).

---

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** for data entry and formatting

---

## Process
1. **Data Extraction**
   - Manually extracted information such as Name, Title, Company, Address, City, State, ZIP, Email, Phone Number, and Website from the image.

2. **Data Organization**
   - Entered the extracted data into a structured spreadsheet with clear column headers.
   - Ensured consistency in formatting for better readability (e.g., uniform capitalization and proper alignment).

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Verified the accuracy of each entry.
   - Marked rows with missing information with N/A (e.g., missing titles or website links) and noted them for potential follow-up research.

4. **Enhancements**
   - Added filters to make the dataset easily searchable.
   - Used basic formatting features (e.g., bold headers, alternate row shading) to improve clarity.

## Challenges
- **Incomplete Data**: Some entries lacked specific information, such as websites or titles. These gaps were left as-is to demonstrate real-world scenarios where data might be incomplete.
- **Ensuring Accuracy**: Manual entry required careful verification to avoid errors in email addresses, phone numbers, or names.

---

## Results
- Created a structured, professional-grade dataset containing 20 entries of professional contact information.
- Documented a clear process for handling and organizing data efficiently.

---

## File Structure
- `Associates_Catalogue.xlsx`: The completed dataset in Excel format.
- `Associates_Catalogue.csv`: The completed dataset in CSV format for portability.
- `Associates catalogue.pdf`: The original image used as the data source.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Improved my ability to manually extract and organize information with high accuracy.
- Gained experience in handling incomplete datasets and documenting areas for improvement.
- Developed an understanding of how to prepare data for future automation or analysis projects.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Automation**: Explore Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to automate data extraction from images.
- **Data Validation**: Implement formulas or scripts to automatically detect duplicates or missing values.
- **Analysis**: Add summary statistics or insights, such as counts of professionals by state or company.
